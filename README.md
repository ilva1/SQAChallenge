Why?
I had a SQA challenge and i wanted to choose the working environment that:
1. has multiple editions
2. supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks
3. has better plugin and extension support
4. is a proprietary software licensed under the Apache License2.0
5. has a great autocomplete feature that makes writing code so much easier.
6. is definitely the winner in performance
